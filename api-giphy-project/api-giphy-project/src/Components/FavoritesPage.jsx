//add pre-existing favorites for different users that are hard coded into the application. Once you do that, add the following functionality:

// Allow someone to go to: /user/username and based off the username, pull that user's favorites from the pre-built list.

// Strip out any code to different files as needed and think about how you might protect against any errors that might pop up.
